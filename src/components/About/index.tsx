      Since jQuery was all the rage in the industry, I've been passionate about
      web.
    </p>
    <p>
      For almost a decade I have had many opportunities to work in a vast
      spectrum of technologies which let me gather a significant amount of
      experience. I spent the last 10 years living in different countries,
      absorbing their culture and way of life. Working for companies and
      individuals around the world I met and learnt from amazing and ambitious
      people.
    </p>
    <p>
      I currently work remotely with a selected freelance client base being open
      for new opportunities.

    <p>Apart from my love for coding, Javascript and Web Technologies.</p>
    <p>
      I also love all things spiritual. Starting almost parallelly with my
      career my spiritual journey has taken me on a great adventure outward and
      well as inward.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout the years of living in Washington DC and Barcelona I have had
      many beautiful experiences that have made me a better person, that have
      shown me the importance of over-all health and well-being (mental,
      physical and emotional).
