      I am a UX Designer and Art Director from Austria living in Berlin.
      Artworks and illustrations were my gateway to the creative industry which
      led to the foundation of my own studio and to first steps in the digital
      world. Art Direction Starting with basic websites several years ago I
      found myself working as an Art Director for complex projects with a
      holistic approach soon. Visually appealing designs, subtle details and
      brand guidelines combined to innovative interfaces across various touch
      points became my daily companion. Out of this love for aesthetic design my
      passion for functionality and structure evolved. Jumping right into
      Photoshop didn’t feel accurate anymore and skipping the steps of building
      a framework based on functionality and usability became inevitable. UX
      Design A user-centered mindset and sensitivity for design turned out to be
      the perfect fit when collaborating with agencies, clients and brands to
      develop digital concepts and solve problems together. This rough framework
      outlines my process of developing digital experiences: 1. RESEARCH and
      gather the present state 2. STRUCTURE setup and content of the project 3.
      CONCEPT AND STRATEGY 4. CREATE, evaluate and iterate deliverables like
      Personas Site maps Use cases and scenarios User flow Sketches and
      Infographics Wireframes Communicating the conceptual approach/UX strategy
      and reasoning behind it, is present during the whole process. I am a UX
